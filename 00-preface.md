# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book started with an idle conversation with Mr. Steddum, where I suggested
some analytical topics that all Warrants should know. He told me that there is
some interest in adding "data literacy" to the curriculum. I wrote an outline
of proposed topics and then realized that this outline would work well as a book.
For the remainder of my WOILE I worked on the text you have here.

This first edition is only four chapters:

1. An introduction to data types and collections using Excel, JavaScript, and R.
We also introduce the term *function* as a foundational concept.
2. A brief discussion of database operations and data processing using SQLite, JavaScript, R, and Go.
3. An explanation of the four moments, with an repeated emphasis of the term *expected value* ($E(x)$), using Excel, R, and JavaScript.
4. An introduction to graph theory terms, concepts, and search algorithms with Neo4j, Go, and Python.

This book contains a lot of code. The reader is *not* expected to be fluent in
*any* of the seven programming languages used. These programs are provided as an
interactive learning opportunity. Source code in this text is provided along with
links to online "playgrounds" where one can edit and run the code using a web browser.
This gives the reader an opportunity to work directly with the material, testing
ideas and learning new technologies. Another reason for teaching with code is
that mathematical notation often hides complexity that one cannot ignore when
solving practical problems.

This first edition contains only four chapters. I would like to add four more to
cover linear modeling, hypothesis testing ($p$-values, $t$-test, $\chi^2$-test),
supervised learning (artificial neural networks and decision trees), and
unsupervised learning (principal component analysis and clustering).
