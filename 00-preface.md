# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book started with a casual conversation with Mr. Jim Steddum.
I suggested some analytical topics that I think all Warrant Officers should learn.
He told me that the Army wants to add "data literacy" topics to Warrant Officer
Professional Military Education (WO PME). I wrote an outline with some proposed
topics, which then formed the basis for this book.

This book contains a lot of code. The reader is *not* expected to be fluent in
any of the programming languages used. These programs are provided as an
interactive learning opportunity. Source code in this text is provided along with
links to online "playgrounds" where one can edit and run the code using a web browser.
This gives the reader an opportunity to work directly with the material, testing
ideas and learning new technologies. Another reason for teaching with code is
that mathematical notation often hides complexity that one cannot ignore when
solving practical problems.
