## Relational algebra

Codd's *relational algebra* is the framework theory describing all modern *database management systems* (DBMS).
The relational algebra can be described with five primitives: *selection* ($\sigma$), *projection* ($\pi$), the *Cartesian product* ($\times$), set *union* ($\cup$), and set *difference* ($\setminus$).

## Filter, map, and reduce 

## Grouping and aggregation 

## Vectorized functions 

## Concurrency 

## Consistency, availability, and partition-tolerance (CAP) theorem 

## Discussion prompts

How does the CAP theorem impact intelligence and fires in relation to the command and control (C2) warfighting function (WfF)? 

Where should unclassified data be stored and processed? 

What are some methods to prevent conflicts among concurrent writes in a shared database? 

What could possibly go wrong when altering database schema? 

## Practical exercises

Create a custom list in SharePoint that provides multiple views showing grouped and aggregated values. 

Given a noisy dataset, identify problems in each column that could influence inclusion and exclusion criteria. 

Implement filter and map in terms of reduce using a programming language which provides reduce. 

Define an “embarrassingly parallel” problem and provide both examples and counterexamples.
