# Dimensionality

## Combinatorics

Suppose one has four children, $\left\{ a, b, c, d \right\}$, and a motorcycle.
The motorcycle can carry only one passenger, so there are four possible *combinations* of children that you can transport by motorcycle:

$$
4 = \left| \left\{
\left\{ a \right\},
\left\{ b \right\},
\left\{ c \right\},
\left\{ d \right\}
\right\} \right|.
$$

The syntax $\left| S \right| = n$ gives the *cardinality* (the size) $n$ of set $S$.

The family adds a sidecar to the motorcycle and can now transport two children at once...
