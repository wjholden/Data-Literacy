# Linear Models

## Sum of squared errors

## Linear regression 

## Polynomial models 

## Pearson correlation coefficient 

## Prediction 

## Overfitting 

## Correlation and causation 

## Discussion prompts

What are confounding factors and how can we identify them? 

When is it useful to generate a linear model with no previous understanding of the data? 

Some data mining techniques fail if the data set contains colinear columns. How might one identify these columns? 

## Practical exercises

Design a novel linear model, using any programming language, that considers time when fitting [Equation] values and creates a biased model (like an EMA). 

Given linear models and their associated [Equation] values among many different columns in a data set, identify the strongest and weakest models, then use plots to support these conclusions. 

Using the Goal Seek feature of Microsoft Excel, estimate the mean of a column by minimizing the sum of squared errors. Compare this value to the arithmetic mean. 

Use more than one tool (such as both Excel and R) to find the line of best fit on a single dataset. Compare and contrast the linear regression generated by each program.
