How does the “curse of combinatorics” create effectively infinite event spaces? 

Suppose a daycare has 1000 toys in the toybox. Each time a child takes a toy from the toybox, a worker records the toy and the (seemingly independent) result of a fair coin toss. After each toy has been pulled ten times, the worker discovers that the coin always landed on heads for the toy shark. How surprising is this outcome? 

A study shows [Equation]. What does this result mean? 

Describe a workplace situation where the Central Limit Theorem applies. 

## Practical exercise

One group generates a random data set that should not fit a normal distribution. Another group takes samples and applies the Central Limit Theorem to estimate the population mean. 

Given a multivariant dataset, use ANOVA to identify the strongest linear relationship between a dependent variable and many independent variables. 

An obscure Filipino superstition claims that the gender of the firstborn child predicts the first parent who will die (e.g., if the eldest child is a son, then the father will pass away before the mother). Create a small data set by surveying the class, then use the [Equation]-test to analyze the strength of the superstition.  

Use a CDF/PDF implementation to convert a uniform random number generator (RNG) into a normal distribution.
