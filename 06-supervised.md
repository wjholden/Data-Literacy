## Discussion prompts

Why might a voice recognition model more reliably understand one accent than another in the same language? How might the model be improved?  

What happens when a model is trained on information that the model itself produced? 

Unlike linear models, neural networks are often initialized with random values. As a result, training two models on the same data might not lead to identical results. What are the ethical implications of having different results in different models? 


## Practical exercises

In any programming language, train an ANN to recognize handwritten characters. Use a test-train split to evaluate the accuracy of the model. 

Create a classification model for an extremely unbalanced data set, then assess the accuracy of the model. 

Create a classification tree by hand to identify Russian military vehicles. 

As a group, create an “ensemble” of different models that vote on the outcome of a classification task.
