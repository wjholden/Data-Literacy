## Discussion prompts

Suppose a dataset contains a sequential numeric identifier for each row. An unsupervised learning method unexpectedly uses this feature to predict an outcome with good accuracy. What does this mean? 

Supposes an embeddings model produces “queen” from “king – man + woman”, but unexpectedly produces “king” from “queen – English + Turkish – Turkish + English”. Why might this occur? 


## Practical exercises

Compile raw ACFT data for the class, perform PCA, and attempt to interpret the first and second components. 

Using the same ACFT data, use cluster analysis to attempt to predict Army component (RA, AR, NG). Use the diagonal of the resulting confusion table to assess model accuracy. 

Model a scheduling problem using a constraint solver.
