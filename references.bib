abstract = {In this paper, we present Google, a prototype of a large-scale search engine which makes heavy use of the structure present in hypertext. Google is designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. The prototype with a full text and hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is available at http://google.stanford.edu/ To engineer a search engine is a challenging task. Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of Web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the Web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and Web proliferation, creating a Web search engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale Web search engine — the first such detailed public description we know of to date. Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they want.}

abstract = {Systems as diverse as genetic networks or the World Wide Web are best described as networks with complex topology. A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.}}

Three distinct intuitive conceptions of centrality are uncovered and existing measures are refined to embody these conceptions. Three measures are developed for each concept, one absolute and one relative measure of the centrality of positions in a network, and one reflecting the degree of centralization of the entire network. The implications of these measures for the experimental study of small groups is examined.}

In this report, the case is made that the technical community is well-positioned to drive progress on both strategic goals. First, in order to reduce memory safety vulnerabilities at scale, creators of software and hardware can better secure the building blocks of cyberspace. This report focuses on the programming language as a primary building block, and explores hardware architecture and formal methods as complementary approaches to achieve similar outcomes. Second, in order to establish accurate cybersecurity quality metrics, advances can be made to address the hard and complex research problem of software measurability. This report explores how such metrics can shift market forces to improve cybersecurity quality across the ecosystem.},

abstract = {This paper revisits the data-information-knowledge-wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy by examining the articulation of the hierarchy in a number of widely read textbooks, and analysing their statements about the nature of data, information, knowledge, and wisdom. The hierarchy referred to variously as the ‘Knowledge Hierarchy’, the ‘Information Hierarchy’ and the ‘Knowledge Pyramid’ is one of the fundamental, widely recognized and ‘taken-for-granted’ models in the information and knowledge literatures. It is often quoted, or used implicitly, in definitions of data, information and knowledge in the information management, information systems and knowledge management literatures, but there has been limited direct discussion of the hierarchy. After revisiting Ackoff’s original articulation of the hierarchy, definitions of data, information, knowledge and wisdom as articulated in recent textbooks in information systems and knowledge management are reviewed and assessed, in pursuit of a consensus on definitions and transformation processes. This process brings to the surface the extent of agreement and dissent in relation to these definitions, and provides a basis for a discussion as to whether these articulations present an adequate distinction between data, information, and knowledge. Typically information is defined in terms of data, knowledge in terms of information, and wisdom in terms of knowledge, but there is less consensus in the description of the processes that transform elements lower in the hierarchy into those above them, leading to a lack of definitional clarity. In addition, there is limited reference to wisdom in these texts. }

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: CrossFit is a type of competitive exercise program
               that has gained widespread recognition. To date, there have been
               no studies that have formally examined injury rates among
               CrossFit participants or factors that may contribute to injury
               rates. PURPOSE: To establish an injury rate among CrossFit
               participants and to identify trends and associations between
               injury rates and demographic categories, gym characteristics,
               and athletic abilities among CrossFit participants. STUDY
               DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiology study. METHODS: A survey was
               conducted, based on validated epidemiologic injury surveillance
               methods, to identify patterns of injury among CrossFit
               participants. It was sent to CrossFit gyms in Rochester, New
               York; New York City, New York; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
               and made available via a posting on the main CrossFit website.
               Participants were encouraged to distribute it further, and as
               such, there were responses from a wide geographical location.
               Inclusion criteria included participating in CrossFit training
               at a CrossFit gym in the United States. Data were collected from
               October 2012 to February 2013. Data analysis was performed using
               Fisher exact tests and chi-square tests. RESULTS: A total of 486
               CrossFit participants completed the survey, and 386 met the
               inclusion criteria. The overall injury rate was determined to be
               19.4\% (75/386). Males (53/231) were injured more frequently
               than females (21/150; P = .03). Across all exercises, injury
               rates were significantly different (P < .001), with shoulder
               (21/84), low back (12/84), and knee (11/84) being the most
               commonly injured overall. The shoulder was most commonly injured
               in gymnastic movements, and the low back was most commonly
               injured in power lifting movements. Most participants did not
               report prior injury (72/89; P < .001) or discomfort in the area
               (58/88; P < .001). Last, the injury rate was significantly
               decreased with trainer involvement (P = .028). CONCLUSION: The
               injury rate in CrossFit was approximately 20\%. Males were more
               likely to sustain an injury than females. The involvement of
               trainers in coaching participants on their form and guiding them
               through the workout correlates with a decreased injury rate. The
               shoulder and lower back were the most commonly injured in
               gymnastic and power lifting movements, respectively.
               Participants reported primarily acute and fairly mild injuries.",

Here “reduced” means, roughly speaking, that the first problem can be solved deterministically in polynomial time provided an oracle is available for solving the second. From this notion of reducible, polynomial degrees of difficulty are defined, and it is shown that the problem of determining tautologyhood has the same polynomial degree as the problem of determining whether the first of two given graphs is isomorphic to a subgraph of the second. Other examples are discussed. A method of measuring the complexity of proof procedures for the predicate calculus is introduced and discussed.},

ABSTRACT={<p>The designing, collecting, analyzing, and reporting of psychological studies entail many choices that are often arbitrary. The opportunistic use of these so-called researcher degrees of freedom aimed at obtaining statistically significant results is problematic because it enhances the chances of false positive results and may inflate effect size estimates. In this review article, we present an extensive list of 34 degrees of freedom that researchers have in formulating hypotheses, and in designing, running, analyzing, and reporting of psychological research. The list can be used in research methods education, and as a checklist to assess the quality of preregistrations and to determine the potential for bias due to (arbitrary) choices in unregistered studies.</p>}

abstract = {Reliability at massive scale is one of the biggest challenges we face at Amazon.com, one of the largest e-commerce operations in the world; even the slightest outage has significant financial consequences and impacts customer trust. The Amazon.com platform, which provides services for many web sites worldwide, is implemented on top of an infrastructure of tens of thousands of servers and network components located in many datacenters around the world. At this scale, small and large components fail continuously and the way persistent state is managed in the face of these failures drives the reliability and scalability of the software systems.This paper presents the design and implementation of Dynamo, a highly available key-value storage system that some of Amazon's core services use to provide an "always-on" experience. To achieve this level of availability, Dynamo sacrifices consistency under certain failure scenarios. It makes extensive use of object versioning and application-assisted conflict resolution in a manner that provides a novel interface for developers to use.},

Furthermore, the expansion of this technique to other areas (other than recurrences) has not been subjected to analysis.This paper examines some of the assumptions.
